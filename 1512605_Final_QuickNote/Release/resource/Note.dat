Both beauty and the beast, the gorgeous Note 8

The design of the Nokia 8 is one of the key elements,
and it’s one of the most – if not the most – beautiful
phones we’ve ever seen with the Nokia branding
emblazoned on the rear

Về giao diện, smartphone này chạy phiên bản ColorOS 3.2
trên nền Android 7. Giao diện này cải tiến nhẹ so với thế hệ
trước và cơ bản giống iOS. Máy loại bỏ app drawer, thay
bằng nhiều màn hình Home. Trên di động này, Oppo trang
bị cảm biến vân tay (ở mặt lưng) và tính năng nhận diện
khuôn mặt.

The Sony Xperia XZs offers improvements that are so
minor to the original Sony Xperia XZ, you might not even
notice them. But overlooking them would be such a shame.

The Mi 6 has a 5.15-inch screen with a 1080-pixel display
that looks good to the naked eye. Pixel density isn't as
sharp on paper as the Galaxy S8, but my eyes didn't strain
trying to read news stories or social media updates. Colors
pop, and while it has a maximum brightness of 600 nits, it goes
all the way down to one at night, helping you not strain your
eye. The phone won't take a long dunking like the Galaxy S8
or LG G6, but it is splash-proof, so you shouldn't worry too
much about small spills.
